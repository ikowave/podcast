Welcome back to another episode of Ikowave, your go-to podcast for the latest news and updates in the world of artificial intelligence. I'm your host and today we have an exciting lineup of AI news and discussions for you. In this 2nd episode, we'll be covering Facebook's massive speech-to-text and text-to-speech release, AI integration in Windows, the resilience of paralegal jobs, and much more. So, let's dive right in!

üî•Top 3 AI news in the past week

Our first news item revolves around Facebook's groundbreaking release. They have introduced an open-source model called MMS (Massively Multilingual Search), which takes speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and language identification to new heights. The significance of this release lies in the fact that while existing STT and TTS models only recognize about 100 languages, Facebook's MMS can handle a whopping 1100 languages! That's a tenfold increase in language recognition capabilities. Moreover, these models can identify and process over 4000 languages. In terms of performance, Facebook claims that MMS has half the error rate of OpenAI's Whisper model. It's safe to say that Facebook is making impressive strides in multilingual AI.

Moving on to our second news item, Microsoft recently made some exciting announcements at the Microsoft Build event. One notable development is the integration of AI directly into the Windows operating system. With the introduction of Windows Copilot, users can now perform various tasks previously available only through Bing Chat, right within the OS. From summarizing emails and documents to rewriting text, Windows Copilot goes beyond expectations by integrating with installed applications. Microsoft is also adopting OpenAI's plugin model, allowing users to interact with AI using ChatGPT and Bing plugins. While this integration brings convenience, there are concerns regarding security and potential vulnerabilities in the OS and antivirus software.

Our final top news story takes us to the legal realm. A recent incident involving ChatGPT and a lawyer highlights the potential hazards of relying solely on AI for critical tasks. In a personal injury lawsuit, a lawyer used ChatGPT to generate a document, including references to several cases supporting their client's claims. However, it turned out that ChatGPT had provided the lawyer with fabricated cases. When asked to produce tangible copies of these cases, the lawyer again turned to ChatGPT, leading to further complications. The judge and Avianca airline's lawyer couldn't locate any of the referenced cases, exposing the lawyer's reliance on AI-generated content. This incident serves as a cautionary tale, emphasizing the importance of using AI tools responsibly and verifying information from reliable sources.
