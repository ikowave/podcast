**AI and Personalization:**

*   An event titled "AI and Personalization: Progress or Invasion of Privacy?" was held featuring Jan Pedersen, former Vice President of Search and Personalization Technologies at Walmart, and Greg Shove, Section CEO.
*   The event discussed how AI enables personalized customer experiences and the challenges associated with scalability, ethics, and data privacy.
*   Jan Pedersen addressed how AI is transforming customer experiences and what can be learned from personalization strategies at major companies like Walmart.
*   The event also covered the challenges and opportunities in implementing AI-driven personalization.
*   The event recording is available to watch.

**Recent AI Model Developments and News:**

*   OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise up to $40 billion at a $340 billion valuation.
*   Google is releasing Gemini 2.0 Flash with faster responses and improved image generation.
*   Krea AI is developing Krea Chat, a text interface for generating and editing images and videos.
