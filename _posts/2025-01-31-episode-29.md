**AI and Personalization:**

*   An event titled "AI and Personalization: Progress or Invasion of Privacy?" was held featuring Jan Pedersen, former Vice President of Search and Personalization Technologies at Walmart, and Greg Shove, Section CEO.
*   The event discussed how AI enables personalized customer experiences and the challenges associated with scalability, ethics, and data privacy.
*   Jan Pedersen addressed how AI is transforming customer experiences and what can be learned from personalization strategies at major companies like Walmart.
*   The event also covered the challenges and opportunities in implementing AI-driven personalization.
*   The event recording is available to watch.

**Recent AI Model Developments and News:**

*   OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise up to $40 billion at a $340 billion valuation.
*   Google is releasing Gemini 2.0 Flash with faster responses and improved image generation.
*   Krea AI is developing Krea Chat, a text interface for generating and editing images and videos.
*   Mistral released Small 3, a 24B-parameter open-source model.
*   Sakana AI unveiled TinySwallow-1.5B, a Japanese language model.
*   ElevenLabs announced a $180M Series C funding round.
*   AI2 introduced TÃ¼lu 3 405B, a large open-source model.

**AI in Music:**

*   Riffusion launched a free AI music platform called Fuzz that generates original music from text, audio or visual prompts and learns user preferences.
*   Riffusion's platform is designed to be intuitive for both professional musicians and casual users.
*   The platform's AI model outperformed competitive models in blind human evaluations.
*   Riffusion raised $4 million in seed funding.

**AI and Problem Solving:**

*   The concept of "Move 37," where AI discovers new, surprising, and brilliant actions through reinforcement learning, is discussed.
*  LLMs are showing early signs of "cognitive strategies," or ways of thinking that are hard to program, in solving problems.
*   It's possible LLMs may discover more efficient ways of solving problems and even develop their own languages.

**AI and Customer Service:**

*   Google Search Labs introduced 'Ask for Me' and 'Talk to a Live Representative' features that use AI to handle phone calls on the user's behalf.
*   'Ask for Me' contacts local businesses to gather information, while 'Talk to a Live Representative' waits on hold with customer service lines.
*  These features use Google's Duplex AI technology for natural voice interactions.

**AI and National Security:**

*   OpenAI has partnered with the U.S. National Laboratories to use their models to drive scientific breakthroughs.
*   OpenAI models will be deployed on the Venado supercomputer at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
*   This partnership will focus on areas such as healthcare, energy, cybersecurity, and national security.
*   OpenAI will support the National Labs' work in nuclear security.
*   The collaboration expands on previous work with Los Alamos on assessing bioweapon risks.
