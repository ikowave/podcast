  summary: AI News September update
---
All right, so get this, OpenAI just dropped their new AI model, and, uh...
01.
01, right?
Right.
And like everyone's saying, it's a big deal.
We all know these LLMs are evolving crazy fast, but I don't know, this one feels different,
you know?
Like OpenAI just took a giant leap or something.
It's the thinking part that's really got people talking, right?
Instead of just like spitting out an answer, 01 actually uses a chain of thought.
It's like it's working through the problem step by step almost.
So it's not just some kind of AI savant.
It's like showing its work.
That's kind of wild.
Yeah, and that's actually what's so cool about it, right?
Because it means 01 can solve these super complex problems.
Like we're talking coding, advanced math, even scientific research, all at a level we
haven't seen before.
Okay, so this is not your grandma's chatbot, right?
Yeah.
We've got a lot to unpack here.
We've got OpenAI's announcements, some analysis from AI expert Dr. Alan Thompson, and even
a glimpse into how this could shake things up at work from Salesforce.
Let's start with OpenAI.
They're making some pretty bold claims.
They are.
And they've got some serious data to back it up.
Take the GPQA benchmark.
It's a test designed to measure like actual scientific reasoning skills, right, 01's performance.
It's exceeding human PhD level accuracy.
Wait, are you serious?
That's insane.
I mean, what does that even look like in the real world?
I mean, imagine scientific breakthroughs happening like at work speed, right?
Yeah.
That's the kind of potential we're talking about.
And it's not just science, either, 01's also crushing it on code forces.
That's that platform for competitive coding challenges.
Hold on.
AI is competing with like human coders now.
And not just competing, it's ranking in the top 10%.
Think about that.
An AI teammate that can code as well as the top 10% of human engineers.
Wow.
That's the potential.
And didn't they also set it loose on the USA Math Olympiad, too?
The AME.
Yeah.
And get this, it ranked in the top 500.
This is a test designed to challenge like the brightest high school math wiz's out there.
To me, that really shows 01's capacity for abstract thinking and logic, you know, something
people always thought was uniquely human.
Okay, so we've established that 01 is really, really smart, like almost unbelievably smart.
But what's the catch?
There's got to be a catch, right?
Well, yeah, let's talk about that.
So we're talking about this AI that's like acing PhD level science and coding circles
around us and who knows, probably doing our taxes in its spare time, right?
Yeah.
But it also sounds a little, I don't know, unnerving.
And I know you've got thoughts on this, especially from Dr. Thompson's analysis, right?
Yeah, Dr. Thompson, he doesn't mince words, you know?
He's straight up calling 01 the most dangerous model ever released.
Okay, whoa, that got my attention.
Dangerous though?
Is this thing going to like stage an AI uprising or something, hacking all our toasters?
It's not so much about 01 going rogue, it's more about the sheer scale of the impact it
could have, right?
Dr. Thompson's argument is that 01's capabilities basically put us on the fast track to AGI,
artificial general intelligence.
Right, right.
And he even put a number on it.
He's saying there's an 81% probability of AGI by 2025.
AGI by 2025, that's really soon.
Okay, remind me, what exactly is AGI again?
And why should we care if it happens by like next Tuesday versus next century?
So AGI, that's the big one, right?
It's basically an AI that can learn and perform any intellectual task that a human can.
It's like the holy grail of AI research.
Some people think it'll be the biggest turning point in human history.
And Dr. Thompson's point is that 01 is showing us that this might not be sci-fi anymore,
you know?
Okay, yeah.
I'm starting to see why Dr. Thompson's a little on edge.
But let's shift gears for a second and talk about how this actually plays out in the real
world.
Dr. Thompson also talks about humanoid robots, right?
Which like, those things are already kind of creeping me out.
And now we're talking about giving them super intelligence.
Yeah, it's not just science fiction anymore.
Dr. Thompson actually cites ARK Invest, which is a pretty big investment firm.
And they're predicting this massive economic boom driven by, you guessed it, humanoid robots
powered by AI, like 01.
We're talking a potential $24 trillion market.
Okay, so now we're talking real numbers.
What are all these robots going to be doing all day?
Flipping burgers, performing surgery.
Think bigger.
Everything from like household chores to those really complex manufacturing tasks.
Imagine a world where no one has to do dangerous or repetitive work anymore because robots
are taking care of everything 24-7.
Okay, so a big part of me would love a robot chef and maid combo at my beck and call 24-7.
Right.
But it also brings up this big question of what happens to all the people whose jobs
those are, you know?
Yeah, I mean, that's the heart of the issue, isn't it?
The potential benefits are huge, but so are the potential disruptions.
And that's why it's so important to be thinking about these questions now.
Like, how can we make sure everyone benefits from this technology, you know?
Right.
So we don't end up with a world full of robots and a whole lot of unemployed humans wondering
where it all went wrong.
Because I've seen that movie, it doesn't end well.
Exactly.
And that's where those conversations about job training programs, education reform, maybe
even universal basic income, those all become so important.
Right, right.
All right, so we've covered the potential good, the potential bad, and the potentially
robot-filled future.
But I want to bring in something a little less apocalyptic, that Salesforce announcement
I mentioned earlier.
So Salesforce drops this news, and it kind of feels like the worst possible time, right?
Talking about an agent-powered work operating system.
Basically, they're going to be integrating these AI agents, things like their own agent
force, and even ones from Adobe and Anthropic right there into Slack.
Yeah, it's interesting timing, for sure.
Right.
It's like we're sitting here talking about AI as this big scary other, and Salesforce
is like, hey, here's AI as your new work buddy.
It's a different way of thinking about it, for sure.
Yeah, give me like a real-world scenario here.
Say I'm, I don't know, a sales rep trying to close a deal.
How's this AI agent thing actually going to help me?
Okay, so picture this.
You're right up against a deadline, right?
Your AI agent is already analyzing all your client's data, figuring out their pain points,
maybe even drafting personalized emails for you.
Or you're stuck on some, I don't know, some technical issue, and boom, your AI agent pulls
up the exact documentation you need, maybe even connects you with the right expert in
like seconds.
So instead of replacing jobs, it's more like AI doing all the tedious stuff.
Yeah.
The stuff that makes you want to bang your head on the desk.
And it frees us up to, I don't know, actually use our brains for once.
Right.
Exactly.
And it's not even just about like efficiency and stuff.
It's about actually making us better at what we do, you know?
Like we still bring the creativity, the strategy, the human touch.
But now we've got this AI teammate who's got our back.
It's that whole humans with AI idea, right?
Not this either-or thing that everyone seems to be freaking out about.
This actually, this feels kind of optimistic, doesn't it?
It does.
And you know what it made me think of?
Robin Sloan, he said this great thing in the memo, he said, it's not boring at all.
The stories are only just beginning.
I love that.
It's like he's saying, yeah, things are changing fast, but we're not just along for the ride,
right?
Like we actually get to, we get to shape how this all plays out.
Exactly.
And that's exactly why we need to be having these conversations.
The future of AI, it's not like some predetermined thing.
It's being shaped right now by the choices we make, the questions we ask, the way we
choose to integrate into our lives.
So what's the takeaway for our listeners then?
What should they be doing like right now to get ready for this wild AI powered future?
I think the biggest thing is don't check out.
You know, stay informed, stay curious, stay engaged.
This technology is changing so fast, it's on us to keep up.
Read articles, listen to podcasts like this one, play around with some of the AI tools
out there.
You know, the more you understand it, the less intimidating it's going to be.
I love it.
So if you take away one thing from today, let it be this.
This is a two-way street, right?
AI is becoming a part of our world, but we get to decide what that looks like.
So how do you want to shape the future?
What role will AI play in your work and your life?
Those are the questions to keep asking.
Well said.
Thanks for joining us for another Deep Dive.
Until next time, stay curious and kid exploring.
