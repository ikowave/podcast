Welcome to Episode 15 of the Ikowave podcast, where we discuss the most recent advancements and trends in the world of artificial intelligence. Today, we dive into the world of personal AI, specifically the recent advancements with Inflection-2.5.

First off, we have the notable memorandum from Dr. Alan D. Thompson. Directed at major organizations like Google, Microsoft, and even significant governments, the memo offers an interesting perspective on the progression of General Artificial Intelligence or AGI. In this memo, Dr. Thompson emphasizes the importance of testing large language models and criticizes the current trend of experts relying on 'vibes' rather than reliable and measurable metrics. He also shares his AI prediction timeline for the rest of 2024, forecasting notable advances in AI technology.

In the realm of personal AI, Inflection AI has been making waves with the release of Inflection-2.5, a smarter version of its empathetic chatbot. Inflection-2.5 not only offers empathy but adds IQ into the mix, making it a highly advanced AI. Remarkably, it achieves performance levels nearly equal to that of GPT-4, but requires only 40% of the computing power GPT-4 needs for training.

But what does all this mean for the average user? Well, Inflection-2.5 is available to all Pi users, and they seem to love it! With over a million daily users exchanging more than four billion messages with Pi, it's clear that the user experience is exceptional. Conversations with Pi typically last 33 minutes, with one in ten lasting over an hour a day.

So, what can we take away from this? The release of Inflection-2.5 represents a significant leap forward in AI technology. With an incredible mix of EQ and IQ, this personal AI is not just empathetic but also boasts significant computational power. As users continue to interact and engage with Pi, the possibilities for future advancements and applications seem limitless.

Now, let's start our dive into the progress of AGI in December 2023, when the AGI percentage was at 64%. This was when DeepMind made a significant announcement: Large Language Models, or LLMs, can now produce new mathematical discoveries and solve real-world problems. This was the first time a genuine new scientific discovery was made by a large-scale language model.

In January 2024, we saw Google use Gemini to correct its codes, reducing the average commit creation time from two hours to seconds. In the same month, DeepMind's AlphaGeometry was trained using 100% synthetic data and began to approach the performance of an average International Math Olympiad gold medalist.

In February 2024, we also saw Google DeepMind launch Gemini Pro 1.5, a highly efficient computing multimodal mixture of experts model. This model has almost perfect recall in long-context retrieval tasks across multiple modalities.

In March 2024, the AGI percentage reached 70% with the release of OpenAI's Sora. Sora is a text-to-video diffusion transformer that can 'understand and simulate the physical world in motion and solve problems requiring real-world interaction.'

Finally, in March 2024, AGI reached 71% with the launch of Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus. This cutting-edge model outperformed GPT-4 across all benchmarks. Additionally, Claude 3 Opus has a context window of 1M+ and advanced agency features about to be launched.

This remarkable progress from December 2023 to today highlights how quickly AI technology is developing and improving. We're excited to see what the future of AGI has in store for us. Stay tuned for the next update.

That's it for this episode. Join us in the next episode, where we'll continue to explore the intriguing world of AI. This is the Ikowave Podcast, where AI comes to life!
