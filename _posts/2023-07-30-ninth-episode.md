Welcome to Ikowave, your weekly guide to the innovations shaping our future. I'm your host Emily and today we'll be looking at some of the latest developments in AI.
We will cover a bunch of stuff in around 4min today. Here we go:
Stability AI released SDXL 1.0, the next iteration of their open text-to-image generation model. SDXL 1.0 has one of the largest parameter counts of any open access image model, built on a new architecture composed of a 3.5B parameter base model and a 6.6B parameter refiner. This added scale allows it to create intricate images from text prompts with unprecedented quality and detail.
Amazon introduced HealthScribe, an AI service that can automatically create medical transcripts and notes. HealthScribe listens to conversations between doctors and patients, transcribes them, and extracts key medical details to populate electronic health records. The transcripts from HealthScribe can be converted into patient notes by the platform’s machine learning models. This has the potential to save healthcare providers hours of administrative time and improve record accuracy.
Researchers from Nvidia, Stanford and other institutions have developed VIMA, a multimodal AI system combining language and physical robotic capabilities. VIMA can perceive its environment through cameras and other sensors, understand natural language instructions, and manipulate objects using its robotic arm. This demonstration of embodied AI learning by interacting with the real world represents an important milestone.
Stack Overflow announced its own generative AI initiative OverflowAI. It includes Generative AI-based search and assistant based on their database of 58 million Q&As, complete with sources cited in the answers. A Visual Studio plugin will also be released. 
Google researchers present Med-PaLM M, a large multimodal generative model fine-tuned for biomedical applications. It interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same set of model weights.
Meta AI introduced Open Catalyst Demo, a service to expedite material science research. It allows researchers to simulate the reactivity of catalyst materials about 1000 times faster than current methods through AI.
Poe, the Chatbot app from Quora, adds three new bots based on Meta’s Llama 2: Llama-2-70b, Llama-2-13b, and Llama-2-7b. Developers experimenting with fine tuning Llama and wanting to use Poe as a frontend can reach out at developers@poe.com.
Researches from CMU build WebArena, a self-hosted simulated web environment for building autonomous agents. 
Stability AI introduced FreeWilly1 and FreeWilly2, open access Large Language Models, with the former fine-tuned using a synthetic dataset based on original LLaMA 65B, and the latter leveraging LlaMA 2 70B.
Wayfair launched Decorify, a generative AI tool for virtual room styling. By uploading a photo, users can see shoppable, photorealistic images of their spaces in new styles.
Cohere introduced Coral, a conversational knowledge assistant for enterprises with 100+ integrations across CRMs, collaboration tools, databases, and more.
Amazon's Bedrock platform for building generative AI-powered apps now supports conversational agents and new third-party models, including Anthropic’s Claude 2 and SDXL 1.0.
Stability AI released open-source StableSwarmUI - a Modular Stable Diffusion Web-User-Interface, with an emphasis on making powertools easily accessible.
As actors strike for AI protections, Netflix is offering as much as $900,000 for a single AI product manager. 
Google researchers have developed a new technique to recreate music from brain activity recorded through fMRI scans.
Australian researchers, who previously demonstrated a Petri-dish cultured cluster of human brain cells playing "Pong," received a $600,000 grant to investigate AI and brain cell integration.
Sam Altman's Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project that uses eye scans to verify identities with the aim to differentiate between humans and AI, has officially launched.
Microsoft is rolling out Bing’s AI chatbot on Google Chrome and Safari. 
Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and OpenAI are launching the Frontier Model Forum, an industry body focused on ensuring safe and responsible development of frontier AI models.
OpenAI has shut down its AI text-detection tool over inaccuracies. 
ChatGPT for Android is now available for download in the US, India, Bangladesh, and Brazil with rollout to additional countries over the next week.
