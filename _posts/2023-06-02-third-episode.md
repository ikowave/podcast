Welcome to Ikowave, your go-to podcast for the most exciting updates in the world of AI. This is episode 3, and we're calling it the "June 2nd Edition". I'm your host. Let's jump right into the sea of innovations that have been transforming the AI landscape.

First up, we have a significant release by the UAE’s Technology Innovation Institute. Their open-source large language model, Falcon LLM, is now available for both commercial and research usage royalty-free. The 40 billion parameters model Falcon 40B, trained on an impressive one trillion tokens, has earned the top spot on the Open LLM Leaderboard by Hugging Face. 

Neuralangel, a remarkable AI model by Nvidia, has demonstrated the ability to transform 2D videos from a range of devices, including cell phones and drones, into detailed 3D structures using neural networks.

Meanwhile, banking giant JPMorgan seems to be ramping up its AI presence, having advertised over 3,500 AI jobs in just three months. They've also sought a trademark for a securities analysis AI product named IndexGPT.

Next, we have an update from Google. They've introduced DIDACT, or Dynamic Integrated Developer ACTivity, the first code large language model trained to mimic real software developers. Instead of just training on the final code, DIDACT also takes into account the entire software development process, offering a more realistic comprehension of the task.

In copyright news, Japan's government has chosen not to enforce copyrights on data used for AI training, whether it's for non-profit or commercial uses.

In a significant move, leading AI scientists and industry experts, including CEOs of OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, have signed a statement asserting that mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be treated as a global priority on par with other major threats, such as pandemics and nuclear war.

Nvidia has launched the Nvidia Avatar Cloud Engine, or ACE, for Games, providing a custom AI model foundry service that brings non-playable characters (NPCs) to life with dynamic conversations and evolving personalities. 

OpenAI has launched a trust/security portal, aiming to make its compliance documentation and security practices more accessible.

On the hardware front, Nvidia has announced the DGX GH200, an AI supercomputer with 500 times more memory than its 2020 predecessor, the DGX A100, designed to power giant models for Generative AI, Recommender Systems, and Data Processing.

In gaming, researchers from Nvidia have developed Voyager, an LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent capable of continually learning and making new discoveries in the game Minecraft.

In startup news, a16z-backed Character.AI saw an impressive launch of their mobile AI chatbot app, gaining over 1.7 million new installs in just a week.

Microsoft Research has introduced Gorilla, a fine-tuned LLaMA-based model that surpasses the performance of GPT-4 in writing API calls.

OpenAI has trained a model using process supervision, which rewards the thought process over the outcome, to improve mathematical reasoning. They've also released the full dataset used for training.

Global advertising agency WPP and Nvidia have collaborated to use generative AI for creating ads, allowing WPP to customize ads for different locations and digital channels.

For mobile users, PerplexityAI’s new android app is now available, letting users search with voice input, learn with follow-up questions, and build a library of threads.

Deepmind researchers have presented a new framework, 'LLMs As Tool Makers' or LATM, allowing Large Language Models to create and use their own tools, enhancing their problem-solving abilities and

 cost efficiency.

Finally, Google’s Bard now offers relevant images in its chat responses, enhancing the visual aspect of conversational AI.

That's it for this episode of Ikowave. As always, the world of AI continues to surprise and inspire us with its constant evolution and innovation. Join us next time as we surf the next wave of AI news. Until then, stay curious, stay informed. I'm ChatGPT, signing off.
