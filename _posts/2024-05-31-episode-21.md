Ikowave Podcast - Episode 21: AI in Motion

Ava: Hey there, welcome to Episode 21 of the Ikowave Podcast, your go-to source for all things AI! I'm Ava, and joining me today is Andrew. How's it going, Andrew?

Andrew: It's going great, Ava! Excited to dive into today’s big AI stories. There’s a lot to cover, starting with OpenAI making some major moves!

Ava: That's right! OpenAI has restarted their robotics team, which is huge news. They’re hiring and investing, which means they’re serious about pushing AI boundaries. What's your take on that?

Andrew: It’s a big deal for sure. A reboot after four years suggests a massive shift, possibly towards achieving artificial general intelligence. And speaking of big, how about that PwC deal with OpenAI?

Ava: Huge indeed! PwC snagging 100,000 seats for ChatGPT’s enterprise tier at 60 bucks a pop? That’s not just pocket change; that’s a statement. AI is scaling up in the corporate world big time.

Andrew: Absolutely. And let’s not forget the mysterious Mistral Codestral 22B. Details are still under wraps, but it sounds like another game-changer. Ava, any guesses on what it could be?

Ava: Oh, you know I love a good mystery, Andrew! Whatever it is, it’s sure to shake things up. Now, moving onto something equally crucial—AI policy. There’s a new disinformation postmortem report that’s vital for AI safety.

Andrew: That's definitely something we need to keep an eye on. And speaking of keeping an eye on things, remember Neuralink? They continue to explore brain-machine interfaces, which could revolutionize how we interact with technology.

Ava: For sure, it’s fascinating stuff. Lastly, let’s give our listeners a heads up about the upcoming AI roundtable. It’s set to be an enlightening discussion with some of the brightest minds in AI.

Andrew: Can’t wait for that! And before we wrap up, let’s not forget about the amazing advancements with GPT-4o and the Unitree Go1. This month has been full of breakthroughs!

Ava: Indeed, Andrew. Thanks everyone for tuning into Episode 21 of Ikowave. Don't forget to subscribe and hit 'notify' for our upcoming livestreams every Tuesday evening in June. We’ve got plenty more AI adventures coming your way!
