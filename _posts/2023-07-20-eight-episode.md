Evelyn: Welcome to ikowave, episode 8! I'm Evelyn.

Larry: And I'm Larry. We've got some exciting AI news stories to discuss today.

Evelyn: That's right! Artificial intelligence is advancing rapidly these days. Let's dive right into our first news story in Chapter 1 about Apple developing its own AI system called Apple GPT to compete with ChatGPT. This could really shake things up!

Larry: Big time! It seems like all the major tech companies are jumping into the AI chatbot race. Apple has been pretty quiet so far while others like Google and Microsoft released their own chatbots. But apparently Apple has secretly been working on Apple GPT using an AI framework they built called Ajax.

Evelyn: Ajax! Like the Greek hero. Though I doubt this AI has superhuman strength. But it sounds really promising that Apple is taking AI seriously now. I'm fascinated to see how Apple GPT compares to ChatGPT when it launches.

Larry: Me too! It will be interesting to see Apple's approach to AI ethics and safety as well. They seem to be taking a thoughtful stance.

Evelyn: For sure. Alright, onto Chapter 2 - this one covers an AI simulation project called SHOW-1 for generating episodic content.

Larry: Episodes? Like TV show episodes? That's wild!

Evelyn: I know right? This startup called Fable Studio built a multi-agent simulation system paired with LLMs like GPT-4 to create entire episodes of shows.

Larry: Whoa, AI-generated episodes? I'm picturing a fully AI-written episode of The Office or something. Would be hilarious and terrifying at the same time. But also impressive that they can simulate story progression and character behavior over a full episode length.

Evelyn: Exactly! It's fascinating research into AI creativity. Making an engaging episodic narrative is tough even for humans. So teaching AI to do it convincingly could be groundbreaking, but also rife with challenges.

Larry: No doubt. I'd watch the first AI-written sitcom though! Okay, onto Chapter 3 - this one covers Meta open-sourcing their LLM called Llama 2.

Evelyn: Yes! This is big news in the AI space. Meta is making Llama 2 available to the public for free under an open source license. And get this - it's competitive with ChatGPT!

Larry: Whoa really? An open source ChatGPT rival? That's pretty cool of Meta to open source such a powerful LLM. This could be a game changer for AI startups and researchers.

Evelyn: Absolutely! LLMs like GPT-3 and ChatGPT have been closely guarded by their creators so far. So having a free high-quality alternative from Meta is huge. Plus Meta partnered with Microsoft to offer Llama 2 through Azure. Exciting times!

Larry: Super exciting! Alright, onto the next news item in Chapter 4. This one covers Microsoft announcing pricing for access to its AI copilot features.

Evelyn: Yes, Microsoft is full steam ahead on bringing AI copilots mainstream. They revealed pricing for both Bing Chat Enterprise and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Bing Chat Enterprise will be $5 per user per month as a standalone service.

Larry: Not bad! So businesses can get an AI chatbot sidekick for pretty cheap it seems. What about the 365 Copilot pricing?

Evelyn: Microsoft 365 Copilot will cost $30 per user per month for certain subscription levels. A bit pricier since it does way more by integrating with Microsoft 365 apps and services. But could be worth it for the productivity boost!

Larry: For sure, AI copilots to the rescue! Employees will love having an AI assistant to offload work to. Oh, and Microsoft also announced a new visual search feature for Bing Chat. Sweet!

Evelyn: Ooh visual search sounds really cool! Next up in Chapter 5 we've got a partnership between OpenAI and the American Journalism Project. They're collaborating to explore how AI could support local journalism.

Larry: Interesting! Using AI to strengthen local news makes a lot of sense. Local papers have been struggling so AI tools could really help with things like data analysis, personalization, and even automating some writing. Exciting to see them trying to shape AI responsibly.

Evelyn: Yes! Guiding AI development to benefit local communities is awesome. This $10 million partnership seems very promising. Responsible AI requires close collaboration so this is a great example!

Larry: For sure. Alright lastly in Chapter 6 we've got some personal news to announce!

Evelyn: Oh yes, huge congratulations to our friend André on his new job! We don't know the details yet but we're so thrilled for him. This podcast episode is dedicated to you, André! Well done!

Larry: Woo hoo! Go André! His uncle Iko must be proud too. Iko has taught us all so much about entrepreneurship and creativity. Big thanks to Iko as well!

Evelyn: Absolutely! Iko is the best. Well, that wraps up the news for this episode. Fun discussing the latest AI innovations with you as always!

Larry: Likewise! AI is advancing so fast, it's hard to keep up! But we'll keep tracking the wave of progress here on ikowave.

Evelyn: For sure! Stay tuned ikowave listeners. Talk to you next time!
