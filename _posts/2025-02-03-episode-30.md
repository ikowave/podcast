*   **OpenAI's Deep Research:**
    *   Launched as a new agentic capability in ChatGPT for Pro users, with Plus and Team access coming next.
    *   Performs multi-step research on the internet for complex tasks, synthesizing information from numerous online sources.
    *   Powered by a version of the upcoming **OpenAI o3 model**, optimized for web browsing and data analysis.
    *   Trained on real-world tasks requiring browser and Python tool use.
    *   Provides fully documented outputs with citations and a summary of its reasoning.
    *   Effective at finding niche, non-intuitive information.
    *   Can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes to complete a research task.
    *   Can browse user-uploaded files, plot graphs, embed images, and cite sources.
    *   Achieved a new high score of 26.6% accuracy on Humanity’s Last Exam.
    *   Reached a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on GAIA, a public benchmark for real-world questions.
    *   **Limitations** include occasional factual errors, difficulty distinguishing authoritative sources, and inaccurate confidence calibration.
    *   Will soon be available on mobile and desktop apps.
    *   Future plans include connecting to more specialized data sources.
    *   Will be combined with Operator for real-world task execution.
    *   Has undergone safety testing and has been rated a medium risk.
*   **OpenAI's Collaboration with U.S. National Laboratories:**
    *   OpenAI is collaborating with U.S. National Labs to use its latest reasoning models for scientific research.
    *   Will deploy **o1 or another o-series model** on Venado, an NVIDIA supercomputer at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).
    *   Aims to accelerate basic science, identify new disease treatments, enhance cybersecurity, improve U.S. energy leadership, and improve U.S. security through threat detection.
    *   Supports nuclear security, with careful review of use cases and AI safety.
*   **Ikowave Podcast: The Memo by LifeArchitect.ai:**
    *   Dr. Alan D. Thompson’s memo discusses AI advancements, including generative AI, AI infrastructure, and large language models.
    *   Highlights that **AI is advancing rapidly towards AGI with an 88% probability**.
    *   **MatterGen (Microsoft)** is using AI for material design, impacting battery and solar cell technology, with TaCr₂O₆ as an example.
    *   **OpenAI's Stargate Project** aims to build a $500B AI infrastructure.
    *   **Meta** is investing $65B in AI compute power.
    *   **DeepSeek-R1** is an open-source AI model from China, nearing OpenAI's o1 and o3 models in benchmark scores.
    *   **Frequent AI use correlates with brain atrophy in decision-making areas**, highlighting cognitive offloading concerns.
    *   Includes visuals of AI-designed materials, a leaderboard of AI models, and an illustration of exponential AI growth.
*   **Other AI Models:**
    *  **GPT-4o** is ideal for real-time, multimodal conversations.
    *   **OpenAI o1** is a large reasoning model with broad world knowledge.
    *   **OpenAI o3-mini** is optimized for cost, coding, and reasoning tasks and is 93% cheaper than o1.
*   **Political Context:**
    *   Canada is appointing a "Fentanyl Czar" and implementing a $1.3 billion border plan.
    *   Trump declared victory due to Canada securing the border, while Mexico sent 10,000 soldiers to its northern border.
*   **Gene Therapy Approvals:**
    *   **Three gene therapies** have been approved in the U.S. for hemophilia as of October 15, 2024.
    *   **Hemgenix (CSL Behring/uniQure)**: Approved in 2022 for Hemophilia B, uses an AAV5 vector delivering a high-activity FIX Padua variant.
    *   **Roctavian (BioMarin)**: Approved in 2023 for Hemophilia A, uses an AAV5 vector with a B-domain-deleted FVIII gene.
    *  **Beqvez (Pfizer):** Approved in 2024 for Hemophilia B, utilizes a modified AAV vector with a serotype rh74 capsid to deliver the FIX Padua variant.
*  **Creole Language Creation**
     * A novel creole language is created by applying specific rules (inspired by various languages) to the English language.
      * The language uses an ergative-absolutive alignment system similar to Hindi with case markers "-ne" for ergative and "-ko" for absolutive.
      * Word order changes to SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).
      * Functional words like articles, auxiliaries, and prepositions are attached as prefixes to following words.
      * Wh-questions exhibit a wh-copying strategy where the wh-phrase is repeated in the main clause, embedded clauses, and in the original base position.
     * The expletive "there" can be used with transitive verbs if the subject is indefinite.
     * Superlative forms are achieved by doubling adjectives/adverbs.
