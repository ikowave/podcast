AI is just exploding right now when you say it seems like every day there's
something new it's true the field is advancing at an incredible pace we've
got a stack of articles here to dig into and we're talking everything from well
like this piece about Warner Bros using AI for generating captions on their
shows which is a great example of how AI is already integrated into so many
aspects of our lives yeah it's almost like we don't even notice it anymore
exactly but then we have these like really out there predictions like this
one from Dr. Singularity yes on X he's predicting millions of super
intelligent AI agents by next year that's a pretty bold claim he even uses the
term ASI artificial super intelligence have you heard that one before I have
it's a term that gets thrown around a lot it's important to distinguish between
AGI artificial general intelligence and ASI artificial super intelligence so AGI
is like the first step you could say that AGI refers to an AI that can perform
any intellectual task a human can okay so then what's ASI ASI is essentially
intelligence that surpasses human capabilities in every way imaginable so
like a whole other level exactly and the debate about how quickly we might reach
AGI let alone ASI is a hot topic and I'm guessing our friend Dr. Singularity is
on the let's say fast end of that debate that's one way to put it he seems to
believe that once we achieve AGI the jump to ASI could be incredibly rapid
like weeks days even minutes he says his argument hinges on the idea that AI
could potentially think thousands of times faster than humans and that this
speed could lead to a kind of intelligence explosion so it's like once AI reaches
a certain point it just takes off on its own that's the general idea behind the
hard take-off scenario wow okay so should we be worried like should we be
getting ready for a robot overlords well it's important to remember that this
is just one experts viewpoint the field of AI is incredibly diverse and there's
no consensus on these timelines so it's not like everyone in the field agrees
with these super fast predictions exactly there's a whole spectrum of
opinions out there okay that makes me feel a little better but still even if
these predictions are even partially accurate it makes you think about the
implications absolutely the potential impact on our world is huge like what
are the biggest things that come to mind well think about the potential impact
on employment for one right like if AI can do our jobs better and faster exactly
and then there's the impact on the global economy on the very fabric of
society it's like we're talking about a fundamental shift in how everything
works precisely and these aren't just hypothetical questions anymore these are
real discussions we need to be having today it's a lot to process it really
is so we've got all these predictions flying around about super intelligence
but then there's also the actual tech that's being developed right now and the
advancements we're seeing on the hardware side are definitely noteworthy right
like this announcement from Intel that you pointed out they're releasing these
new AI chips the Xeon 6 and Gouty 3 these chips are specifically designed for
AI workloads and they're claiming some pretty impressive performance gains yeah
it sounds like a big deal so how exactly does this tie into everything we've
been talking about well it all comes down to the fact that AI requires a ton of
processing power and the more powerful the hardware the more sophisticated the
AI algorithms can be it was like better hardware paves the way for better AI
precisely and these new chips from Intel are just one example of this trend we're
seeing a lot of investment in AI hardware right now from other companies to not
just Intel oh absolutely companies like NVIDIA Google they're all in the race to
build the most powerful AI chips it's like a whole new kind of arms race it
away it is yeah and this brings us back to dr singularities point about
exponential progress as hardware improves it can really accelerate the
development of AI so it's like a feedback loop almost exactly advancements in
hardware lead to advancements in software which then lead to even more advanced
hardware and so on and this is happening right now it's happening as we speak
but it's not the only story we also have companies like Apple who are taking a
much more cautious approach to AI development right like with Siri exactly
Apple has always been known for its focus on user experience and it seems
like they're applying that same philosophy to AI so they're not rushing to
release new AI features just for the sake of it it seems like they're more
concerned with making sure those features are actually useful and well
integrated and that they work seamlessly precisely and this cautious approach
might seem at odds with the whole idea of an imminent AI explosion like maybe
it's not going to happen as fast as some people think it's certainly possible
Apple strategy highlights the fact that technological progress isn't always a
straight line there could be unexpected roadblocks unforeseen challenges so it's
not just as simple as AI is going to get super smart super fast exactly and this
is why it's so important to consider different perspectives we've got these
predictions of rapid advancement but we also have companies like Apple pump in
the breaks a bit so where do we go from here how do we make sense of all this
well one way is to zoom out a bit to look at the bigger picture and that's
what this excerpt from the intelligence age encourages us to do the
intelligence age huh I like it sounds kind of grand it does doesn't it and it
really gets you thinking about these long-term trends we're talking about yeah
and the author definitely doesn't shy away from the big picture does he not at
all he's got some pretty bold claims about the potential of AI but he's not
just like blindly optimistic is he no I wouldn't say that yeah he acknowledges
the challenges to which is important right because it's not all gonna be
sunshine and roses exactly they're gonna be some bumps along the way for sure
like what kind of bumps are we talking about here for one thing he talks about
the potential for social disruption right like how do we make sure everyone
benefits from these advancements exactly and then there are the ethical
considerations which is something we haven't really dug into yet it's a huge
topic like how do we ensure that AI is used for good and not for harm right
because that's always a risk with powerful new technology isn't it it is
and it's something we need to be thinking about very carefully especially with
something as potentially world-changing as AI absolutely and that's what makes
this whole conversation so fascinating we're talking about shaping the future
here no pressure right so where does that leave us after this deep dive well I
think the biggest takeaway is that there's no one size fits all answer right
because we've heard a lot of different perspectives today we have from those
who believe super intelligence is right around the corner to those who are
taking a more cautious approach and it's important to consider all those viewpoints
right absolutely because the truth is probably somewhere in the middle yeah
it usually is and the more informed we are the better equipped will be to navigate
this new landscape exactly so the next time you see a headline about AI don't
just take it at face value think critically ask questions consider the
implications because knowledge is power right especially when it comes to
something as complex as AI goodness it better myself it's all about being
engaged and informed citizens of this intelligence age we're entering well said
and on that note we'll wrap up this deep dive into AI big thanks to you for
breaking it all down with us my pleasure always happy to geek out about AI and to
all our listeners out there keep this brains buzzing and if you're really up
for a challenge think about this what what a world with super intelligent AI
actually look like and what can we do today to help shape that future in a
positive way until next time
