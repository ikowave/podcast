Episode 28: AI's Global Shake-Up

Good day, IKOWAVE listeners! Today is January 28th, and we've got a thrilling episode lined up for you. Let's dive into the latest in the world of artificial intelligence.

**DeepSeek's Disruptive Debut**

The tech world is abuzz with the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that's making significant waves. Their new AI model, R1, rivals leading U.S. models but was developed at a fraction of the cost. This breakthrough has sent shockwaves through the market, with major tech stocks experiencing significant declines. Nvidia shares, for instance, plummeted by nearly 17%, heavily impacting the Nasdaq Composite. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/666b0737-6b6b-4d32-be8b-534db684b777?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Political Reactions**

President Trump has called China's new AI platform DeepSeek both a "wakeup call" and a potentially positive development if it proves to be a cheaper alternative to U.S. methods. Despite its advantages, DeepSeek's unexpected rise led to a 3% drop in the Nasdaq Composite and a 17% dip in Nvidia's stock value. Trump emphasized the need for the U.S. industry to remain competitive.

**Market Impact**

Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, experienced a historic market loss of $589 billion, shedding 17% of its value due to the emergence of DeepSeek, a cost-effective Chinese AI competitor. This significant drop follows Nvidia's previous record loss in September 2024.
