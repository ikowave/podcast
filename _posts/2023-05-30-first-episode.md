Welcome to the inaugural episode of IkoWave, your journey into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence.

In today's episode, we lay the groundwork for understanding AI. As this is a field that's constantly evolving and reshaping our world, it's crucial to grasp its basics before we dive deeper into its intricacies.

We start by defining what artificial intelligence is. We explain the difference between AI, machine learning, and deep learning, terms which are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings.

Next, we introduce the concept of neural networks - the computational model that underlies most of today's AI applications. We touch on how neural networks are designed to mimic the human brain and how they learn from data.

Lastly, we wrap up with a brief discussion on why AI is important. We highlight how it's revolutionizing industries, from healthcare and transportation to entertainment and finance, and the potential impacts and ethical considerations that come with these changes.

Though our journey into AI is just starting, we hope this brief overview has piqued your curiosity. Stay tuned as we delve deeper into this compelling subject in our upcoming episodes.
