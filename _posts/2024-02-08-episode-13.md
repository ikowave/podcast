Welcome to Episode 13 of Ikowave, the podcast where we navigate the fascinating world of artificial intelligence. Today, we're diving deep into two recent memos that surfaced on January 31st and February 8th of 2024. These memos reveal some groundbreaking updates in the realm of AI, from Neuralink's telepathy device to Google's Gemini Ultra 1.0. So, sit back, relax, and let's explore the latest AI developments together.  
   
The January 31st memo starts with a bang, revealing the first successful human implant by Neuralink, the brain-computer interface company founded by Elon Musk. The product, aptly named 'Telepathy', is a groundbreaking innovation that aims to enable individuals who have lost the use of their limbs to control electronic devices just by thinking. Musk's vision with this technology is to help people like Stephen Hawking communicate faster than a speed typist, or an auctioneer. The prospect of turning thought into action without any physical intervention is revolutionary and could open up a world of possibilities for people with mobility issues.  
   
The memo also unveils the exciting news about Google's ambitious project, 'Gemini Ultra 1.0'. Expected to be the largest and most powerful model in the world as of February 2024, Gemini Ultra is designed to outperform all other models. Trained on a staggering 30 trillion tokens, this AI behemoth could have a profound impact on efficiency, productivity, and the rapid approach of the 'post-scarcity' or abundance economy. Imagine a world where most of our tasks are automated and performed more efficiently by AI — that's the promise held by Gemini Ultra.  
   
In a heartwarming twist, the memo also shares the story of a Russian programmer, Alexander Zhadan, who found love with the help of a ChatGPT-based chatbot. His AI assistant interacted with over 5,000 potential matches before finding 'the one'. This unique love story serves as a stark reminder of how AI can potentially transform our personal lives and relationships in the near future. It also raises interesting questions about the role of AI in our social interactions and the ethics surrounding its use in such personal contexts.  
   
Now, let's move on to the memo from February 8th. It starts with a powerful quote from Mustafa Suleyman, founder of DeepMind and Inflection AI. He emphasizes that we are witnessing a new species grow around us — AI. This transition, according to Suleyman, is a significant event that the world is still trying to fully comprehend. He calls the navigation of AI development and integration the "great meta-problem" of the 21st century, highlighting the challenges and opportunities that come with this technological revolution.  
   
The memo also discusses Openwater's non-invasive brain-machine interfaces. These devices, which can be worn like a beanie or ski cap, represent the cutting edge of AI technology. By open-sourcing this technology, Openwater is inviting the global community of developers and researchers to contribute to this revolutionary project, potentially accelerating its development and broadening its applications.  
   
Finally, the memo touches on the integration of AI in the education system. The city of Oslo in Norway has acquired GPT 3.5-Turbo licenses for education and assessment for 110,000 students and staff. This move marks a significant step in the incorporation of AI into the educational fabric, and it will be interesting to see how this influences teaching and evaluation methods in the future.  
   
In conclusion, these memos remind us of the breathtaking pace at which AI is developing and the vast potential it holds for transforming every aspect of our lives. From Neuralink's telepathy device to Google's Gemini Ultra 1.0 and the integration of AI in education, we're witnessing the dawn of a new era. As we continue to ride the wave of AI innovations and breakthroughs, stay tuned to Ikowave for the latest updates.
