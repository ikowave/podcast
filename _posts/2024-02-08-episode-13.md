Welcome to Episode 13 of Ikowave, the podcast where we navigate the fascinating world of artificial intelligence. Today, we're diving deep into two recent memos that surfaced on January 31st and February 8th of 2024. These memos reveal some groundbreaking updates in the realm of AI, from Neuralink's telepathy device to Google's Gemini Ultra 1.0. So, sit back, relax, and let's explore the latest AI developments together.   


    

The January 31st memo starts with a bang, revealing the first successful human implant by Neuralink, the brain-computer interface company founded by Elon Musk. The product, aptly named 'Telepathy', is a groundbreaking innovation that aims to enable individuals who have lost the use of their limbs to control electronic devices just by thinking. Musk's vision with this technology is to help people with disabilities communicate faster than a speed typist, or an auctioneer. The prospect of turning thought into action without any physical intervention is revolutionary and could open up a world of possibilities for people with mobility issues. If only Stephen Hawkings could see this he would be for sure one of the elected to be testing this program!  


The memo also unveils the exciting news about Google's ambitious project, 'Gemini Ultra 1.0'. Expected to be the largest and most powerful model in the world as of February 2024, Gemini Ultra is designed to outperform all other models. Trained on a staggering 30 trillion tokens, this AI behemoth could have a profound impact on efficiency, productivity, and the rapid approach of the 'post-scarcity' or abundance economy. Imagine a world where most of our tasks are automated and performed more efficiently by AI — that's the promise held by Gemini Ultra. He mentions that Google users can use the Gemini Ultra 1.0 model as ‘Gemini Advanced’, in 150 countries, via subscription with a grace period and then US$19.99/month. You can try it today. After entering your card details, you can use the Gemini Ultra 1.0 model as ‘Gemini Advanced’ inside the platform formerly known as Bard: https://gemini.google.com/. Dr. Alan mentions "My initial tests are not positive, but I am expecting that they still have to iron out some issues during this launch period. I will update this web edition as we proceed." 


 He proceeded and sent further updates, he notes that "Gemini Advanced gives you access to Ultra 1.0, though we might occasionally route certain prompts to other models.’ What is Gemini advanced? Well according to the documentation, "Gemini Advanced gives you access to Google’s most capable AI model, Ultra 1.0. With Ultra 1.0, it’s far more capable at highly complex tasks like coding, logical reasoning, following nuanced instructions, and creative collaboration. Plus, it will continue to expand with new and exclusive features. Gemini Advanced gives you access to Ultra 1.0, though we might occasionally route certain prompts to other models."


Gemini Advanced with Ultra 1.0 is available in English only and for over 18 users only as part of a new Google One AI Premium planOpens in a new window. Gemini in Gmail, Docs, and more will soon be available 


What's interesting as well is that Google agentized Gemini to fix their own software, as Dr. Alan Thompson wrote, "Yes, ‘agentized’ is a word, and Google did it. This is exclusive in that no media has picked it up, but the paper and code are available (for free). Google has created an agent using the Gemini Pro model to trawl through their internal codebase and fix bugs. 


 continues with "…leveraging AI to scale our ability to fix bugs, specifically those found by sanitizers in C/C++, Java, and Go code… harnessed our Gemini model to successfully fix 15% of sanitizer bugs discovered during unit tests, resulting in hundreds of bugs patched… 


 Instead of a software engineer spending an average of two hours to create each of these commits, the necessary patches are now automatically created in seconds [by Gemini]. 


 Approximately 95% of the commits [fixed by Gemini] sent to code owners were accepted without discussion. This was a higher acceptance rate than human-generated code changes, which often provoke questions and comments… 


 Reviewers may have had greater trust in the solutions because they were generated by [AI] technology. The prompt given to Gemini [The simplest you can imagine] in this project was: 


 

"You are a Senior Software Engineer tasked with fixing sanitizer errors. Please fix them."


 

These are the first glimpses of a completely new economy, and the new way of doing things in humanity’s next revolution: 


 

Mar/2023: OpenAI uses GPT-4 to help write the GPT-4 paper: ‘GPT-4 was used in the following ways: to help us iterate on LaTeX formatting; for text summarization; and as a copyediting tool.’ Read more: GPT-4 Technical Report (appendix) 


 

Dec/2023: OpenAI uses GPT-4 to prepare GPT-5 and future models: ‘For instance, we’re leveraging the immense capabilities of GPT-4 to innovate on safety, trimming the time it takes to undertake some safety processes down from months to hours.’ Read more: OpenAI—written evidence to UK govt (PDF) 


 

Jan/2024: Google uses Gemini to fix their code: ‘Instead of a software engineer spending an average of two hours to create each of these commits, the necessary patches are now automatically created in seconds [by Gemini].’ Read more: Google—AI-powered patching: the future of automated vulnerability fixes (PDF). 


 

If a lumbering giant like Google can use AI to optimize its processes by just a few percentage points (for now), consider the immediate impact on efficiency, productivity, goods, services, happiness(!), and the rapid approach of the ‘post-scarcity’ or abundance economy (wiki)… 


 

Couple this with two more data points: 


 

12/Jan/2024: Google fires 1,000 workers after parent company announced firing 12,000 (6%) employees. 


 7/Feb/2024: Microsoft CEO: ‘AI could power 10% [500 billion dollars] of the $5-trillion Indian economy’.


Dr. Alan D. Thompson also shares in this memo a nice table that he compiles and have people curious about why he keeps this table. The table provides a comparative overview of the training compute details for various AI models from GPT-3 onwards. Starting with GPT-3, trained in April 2020, we see it utilized Nvidia's V100 chips, requiring 10,000 of them to achieve a maximum of 130 TFLOPs per second, with a training duration of 15 days. Moving to GPT-4, there's an increase in chip count to 25,000 A100 chips, and a substantial extension in training time to 95 days. The next significant leap is with the Gemini model, which, while operating at a slightly lower TFLOPs rate, harnesses a massive 57,000 TPUv4 chips for 100 days, resulting in an equivalent of over 15,000 human years of computing time. Finally, GPT-5 pushes the envelope even further, using H100 chips over 120 days, amounting to an even greater number of human years at a much higher cost. This progression underscores the exponential growth in resource allocation and technological advancements in AI training. Dr. Alan D. Thompson, explains, on his own words: "All of the data is available in various papers and repositories, but had not been brought together in plain English in this way at any stage. Why not?! It is completely mesmerizing to know these kinds of details about our evolving superintelligence; that Google Gemini used significantly more compute than OpenAI GPT-4, that Gemini was trained for the equivalent of 15,000 years at a retail cost of 600 million dollars, and that the next frontier models will be measured in billions of dollars of training compute spend."


In a heartwarming twist, the memo also shares the story of a Russian programmer, Alexander Zhadan, who found love with the help of a ChatGPT-based chatbot. His AI assistant interacted with over 5,000 potential matches before finding 'the one'. This unique love story serves as a stark reminder of how AI can potentially transform our personal lives and relationships in the near future. It also raises interesting questions about the role of AI in our social interactions and the ethics surrounding its use in such personal contexts.   


    

Now, let's move on to the memo from February 8th. It starts with a powerful quote from Mustafa Suleyman, founder of DeepMind and Inflection AI. He emphasizes that we are witnessing a new species grow around us — AI. This transition, according to Suleyman, is a significant event that the world is still trying to fully comprehend. He calls the navigation of AI development and integration the "great meta-problem" of the 21st century, highlighting the challenges and opportunities that come with this technological revolution.   


    

The memo also discusses Openwater's non-invasive brain-machine interfaces. These devices, which can be worn like a beanie or ski cap, represent the cutting edge of AI technology. By open-sourcing this technology, Openwater is inviting the global community of developers and researchers to contribute to this revolutionary project, potentially accelerating its development and broadening its applications.   


    

Finally, the memo touches on the integration of AI in the education system. The city of Oslo in Norway has acquired GPT 3.5-Turbo licenses for education and assessment for 110,000 students and staff. This move marks a significant step in the incorporation of AI into the educational fabric, and it will be interesting to see how this influences teaching and evaluation methods in the future.   


    

In conclusion, these memos remind us of the breathtaking pace at which AI is developing and the vast potential it holds for transforming every aspect of our lives. From Neuralink's telepathy device to Google's Gemini Ultra 1.0 and the integration of AI in education, we're witnessing the dawn of a new era. As we continue to ride the wave of AI innovations and breakthroughs, stay tuned to Ikowave for the latest updates. See you next time on the next episode of Ikowave!
